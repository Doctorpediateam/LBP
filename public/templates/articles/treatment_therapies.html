                        <p>If you&rsquo;re reading this, you&rsquo;re most likely experiencing back pain &ndash; which, perhaps not coincidentally, is one of the most popular reasons for visiting a doctor or having to take off work. Lower back pain is also a major cause of disabilities on a global scale. In fact, the majority of people have suffered from back pain at least once in their lives.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>We&rsquo;re happy to tell you that there are a variety of treatments and therapies that should bring relief and that surgeries are rarely needed except in the most extreme scenarios.</p>

                        <h2>Treatments</h2>
                        <p>Fortunately there are a number of treatments for lower back pain, but in general you should persist with as much as your regular activities as you can tolerate. Light activities like walking or daily living are recommended &nbsp;as long as they do not increase your pain. Bed rest is only recommended for small increments of time. Instead, lay on your back with a pillow elevating your knees or lay on a floor, bending your knees at a 90 degree angle and resting on a chair&gt; &nbsp;These positions should help, but be sure not to stay in these positions for long periods of time.</p>
                        <h2>Medications</h2>
                        <p>Many analgesic pain medications administered as an adjuvant to your treatment plan help relieve pain. They are available with or without a physician&rsquo;s order. Consult your pharmacist or healthcare provider before starting any medication of self-treatment program. If pain has persisted for more than three months, it is time to make a doctor&rsquo;s appointment. Read all labels before taking any medications for the appropriate dose and side effect information.</p>
                        <p>Treatment options include:<br /><strong>Over-The-Counter Pain Relief </strong>&ndash; To help relieve lower back pain, check into NSAIDs &ndash; which simply means non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen (that includes Motrin, Advil and others). You can also look into drugs containing naproxen sodium (Aleve, for example) but do not over-use them as that can bring with it side effects.</p>
                        <p><strong>How do they work?</strong> NSAIDs block inflammatory substances, prostaglandins, which the body produces in response to trauma or injury. The accumulation leads to pain, swelling, inflammation, and fever. Pain can last a short time or become a chronic long-term condition.</p>
                        <p><strong>What are some side effects?</strong> Most NSAIDs can cause an upset stomach, heartburn and on the far end of the spectrum stomach ulcers and bleed. Lower the risk of gastrointestinal problems by following the recommendation of taking these medications with food. We can be allergic to any drugs; therefore, watch for signs of a rash, wheezing, and throat swelling. If this occurs, call your doctor or emergency responders. If you are taking aspirin daily of another condition, do not take NSAIDs without your physician&rsquo;s approval. There are alternative pain treatments.</p>
                        <p>Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is one option that treats pain by a similar mechanism and does not cause stomach distress. It has analgesic properties with fewer side effects. Do not drink alcohol while taking any form of acetaminophen as severe liver problems occur. &nbsp;</p>
                        <p>There are many pain medications available by <strong>physician&rsquo;s prescription</strong> as well. They differ in how they work, the duration of action, costs, and side effect profile. Some examples include celecoxib (Celebrex), diclofenac (Voltaren), meloxicam (Mobic), and nabumetone (Relafen). No medication is side effect free! Prescriptions have been linked to gastrointestinal problems, ulcers, and kidney damage. Always watch how your body reacts to taking anything new. Call your doctor right away.</p>
                        <h2>Ice/Heat</h2>
                        <p>Apply ice and heat alternately to the painful area to relax muscles and lessen the inflammation. Cycle the two for twenty minutes each at a time and do this 2-3 times a day.</p>
                        <h2>Topical Pain Relief</h2>
                        <p>These include creams, salves, and ointments, all of which can be bought at any drugstore or supermarket. You simply rub these substances into the skin where the pain is.</p>
                        <p>These products contain a topical numbing agent or anesthetic. Also, some may have methyl salicylate a well-known counterirritant. This ingredient makes the skin feel cold then warm. &nbsp;They work well for minor aches and pains and for people who cannot take anti-inflammatory therapy. &nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Some examples include Lidocaine&reg;, Icy Hot&reg; or Aspercreme&reg;, Methyl salicylate or capsaicin cream.</p>
                        <p><strong>Some people experience side effects skin </strong>tenderness, burning sensation, swelling, blistering, severe redness, and unusual pain at the site of application.</p>
                        <h2>Antidepressants</h2>
                        <p>Sometimes, a low dose of specific forms of anti-depressants can bring relief to certain types of back pain, regardless of their effect on depression. Look for tricyclic antidepressants &ndash; amitriptyline, for example.&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>Muscle Relaxants</h2>
                        <p>Your doctor might prescribe you a muscle relaxant if you discover your back pain hasn&rsquo;t disappeared with over-the-counter pain relief. Be aware that taking muscle relaxants have side effects that can include sleepiness and dizziness.</p>
                        <h2>Narcotics</h2>
                        <p>As long as your doctor is supervising you, you could consider narcotics. They also come with similar side effects to muscle relaxants &ndash; perhaps even stronger. &nbsp;Some physicians are hesitant to prescribe narcotics because they can be habit forming and/or abused. &nbsp;If other back pain therapies have not worked for you, you can speak with your doctor to discuss whether it makes sense to try a narcotic. Common side effects of these medicines include constipation, drowsiness, itching, nausea and/or vomiting.</p>
                        <p>For severe pain unrelieved by other therapies, narcotic analgesics are a temporary option. With each one there is a risk of tolerance and addiction. You and your physician are in the best position to determine opioid narcotic administration for your pain level. For these therapeutic classifications, the benefits must outweigh the risks.</p>
                        <p>Some famous medication names are hydrocodone, codeine, and morphine. They are central-acting analgesics that dull the sense by blocking pain impulses to the brain and central nervous system. As such, common side effects include dizziness, confusion, nausea, dry mouth, blurry vision, and constipation. &nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>Injections</h2>
                        <p>Cortisone injections &ndash; anti-inflammatory medication given by your doctor &ndash; are another step in ridding oneself of back pain. These are given if pain is growing and reaching down your leg because they aid in lessening inflammation around nerves. The injection goes into the epidural space (the area around your spinal cord). Be aware that the relief lasts less than a few months, so check with your doctor to see if you need to get a follow-up injection.</p>
                        <p>Additional corticosteroid anti-inflammatory choices contain the oral form of cortisone, dexamethasone, used for arthritis and severe allergies, methylprednisolone, and prednisone. All require a physician&rsquo;s prescription order.</p>
                        <h2>Physical Therapy/Exercise</h2>
                        <p>This is where the pedal meets the metal, as therapy is a mainstay of back treatments. If you visit a physical therapist, you can find comfort in a variety of treatments including electrical stimulation, muscle-release techniques, heat, and even ultrasound.</p>
                        <p>Once your pain begins lessening, you can then move on to exercises designed to improve flexibility, invigorate back/abdominal muscles, and tone your posture. With increased regularity of these treatments, you lessen the odds of your pain coming back.</p>

                        <h2>Surgery</h2>
                        <p>Possibly the last resource for dealing with back pain, surgery is also one of the least-needed. If you&rsquo;re experiencing increasing muscle weakness or unrelenting leg pain stemming from nerve compression, surgery is an option to be explored. &nbsp;Beyond that, surgery is usually only considered in cases of pain tied to structural issues including spinal stenosis (a narrowing of the spine) and herniated disks.</p>
                        <p>You should also be aware of how sitting affects your back pain and what you can do to alleviate it. Measures include:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Using back support Sitting for short intervals (10-15 mins)</li>
                        <li>Keeping hips and knees at same angle and placing feet flat on the floor.</li>
                        <li>If driving, adjusting the seat closer to the steering wheel</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Other tips include:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Do not lift objects at all.</li>
                        <li>If you must stoop down to pick something up, never bend forward at the waist with your knees in a straight position.</li>
                        <li>When reaching for something use two hands and use a foot stool/chair to stand on.</li>
                        <li>For sleeping, have a firm mattress.<br />When coughing/sneezing, stand and bend slightly backwards (this improves the spine curvature).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>Alternative Care</h2>
                        <p>There are a handful of treatments that don&rsquo;t fall under the other, strictly medical categories. We &nbsp;call these &ldquo;alternative&rdquo;and are not always medically proven. They include:</p>
                        <p><strong>Yoga</strong> &ndash; Various types of yoga can work wonders on back pain. Yoga works by stretching and strengthening back muscles and can even improve posture via its positions and breathing exercises. If certain positions increase your pain, simply modify them so they become less painful but still helpful.</p>
                        <p><strong>Chiropractic help</strong> &ndash; A licensed chiropractor works with their hands to move and shape your spine.</p>
                        <p><strong>Massage </strong>&ndash; A licensed masseuse can also help with muscle pain. Alternatives include chiropractors, Rolfing therapists, and sports medicine practitioners. Consult your healthcare provider to discern the best options for you!</p>
                        <p><strong>Acupuncture</strong> &ndash; This is the art of inserting clean, stainless steel needles into specific points. Many people claim that acupuncture really assists in relieving back pain so it&rsquo;s worth checking into.</p>
                        <h2>After Care</h2>
                        <p>To keep your back pain-free in the future, there are some easy methods to follow. They include:</p>
                        <p><strong>Exercise</strong> &ndash; Low-impact aerobic activities increase strength in the back, so go walking or swimming.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p><strong>Weight </strong>&ndash; Maintain a healthy weight because excess pounds strain back muscles. In some cases, losing weight can help you stop back pain happening again.</p>
                        <p><strong>Posture </strong>&ndash; Keep up a neutral pelvic position. If you have to stand for hours at a time, keep a foot on a small footstool to ease the pressure and alternate feet. When sitting, add a pillow/rolled towel by the small of your back to keep the curvature in place. Move frequently &ndash; at least every half-hour.</p>
                        <h2>In Summary</h2>
                        <p>You&rsquo;ll be happy to know that 90% of people suffering lower back pain only take up to a couple of weeks to become symptom-free and the remaining 10% get better within a few months.</p>
